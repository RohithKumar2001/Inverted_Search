# Inverted_Search
An inverted search system to enable fast and accurate retrieval of documents based on user queries, utilizing inverted indexing techniques to optimize search efficiency of documents based on terms or keywords. Unlike normal indexing methods where documents are indexed by their IDs, inverted indexing flips this concept by indexing terms and mapping them to the documents they appear in.
